# Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) E-Commerce Back End

## Description

The website does not have a proper working back end, I want to build the back end for an e-commerce site. I will need to work with Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with MYSQL database. This will help the e-commerce site compete with other e-commerce companies.
